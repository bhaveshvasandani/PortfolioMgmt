# Devops_RESTful
You have been asked to develop a RESTful service for a client. Since this is a fictional client, you are free to create a service that manipulates any resource you like. The only requirement is that it must be RESTful according to the guidelines that we learned in class!  The service must support the complete CRUD lifecycle calls plus List, Query, and at least one Action:  List Resources Read a Resource Create a Resource Update a Resource Delete a Resource Query Resources by some attribute of the Resource Perform some Action on the Resource This assignment is in three parts and will bring together everything you have learned in the first half of the semester. Since this is a course on DevOps and one of the fundamental tenants of DevOps is Collaboration, this will be a group project.
